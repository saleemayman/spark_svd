# spark_svd

The code computes the SVD of a sparse matrix. Initial matrix data is stored in a comma-separated file. The data is stored in matrix coordinate form with 3 columns: row id, column id and the matrix entry for that row and column id. 

The code is written in Scala and the jar file is compiled using sbt.
